            During the early stage of reforestion Indonesian farmers plant profitable agricultural products among the newly planted trees.
            <br /><br />
            Agriculture and reforestation influence each other in many positive ways: agricultural products protect the young tropical trees from getting overgrown by elephant grass. Trees enrich the quality of the soil and provide shade.
            <br /><br />
            BOS guarantees to buy fruit like papaya and pineapples from the farmers, market them regionally or use them for self-supply. The supply of the orangutans in Wanariset rehabilitation center alone takes about 1000 kg of fruit daily.

            A circle of sugar-palm plantations is being planted all
            around the nature reserve.  Sugar as a main product is
            supposed to support hundreds of families in the
            future. And - the circle forms a barrier against the much
            feared forest fires.  <br /><br /> An inner wall of thick
            thorny salak palms is supposed to prevent the intrusion of
            cattle into the nature reserve as well as the breakout of
            orangutans.  Moreover, the fruit of these palms provides
            pleasant tasting food for humans and animals.
