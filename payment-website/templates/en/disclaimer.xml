    <p>
      The reforestation in Samboja Lestari is now, after
      10 years, of work nearly completed. However, there
      is still the need to maintain the planted juvenile
      trees and to protect them from fire in the dry
      season. Beside that your donation is urgently needed
      to support the sun bear enclosure, and to finance
      the rehabilitation process of the orangutans in the
      rehabilitation stations. The first releases of
      orangutans from Samboja Lestari are planned for the
      year 2012; for the preliminaries large sums are
      needed.  Please note: With your donation you are not
      purchasing any piece of land or any rights toward
      this land, and your donation does not result in any
      duties whatsoever. BOS guarantees that the land will
      exclusively be reserved for the benefit of
      sustainable nature- and wildlife protection.
